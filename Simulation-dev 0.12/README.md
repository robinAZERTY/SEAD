Simulation-development kit v0.12
==========================

new features:
- new sensor : magnetometer
- simulate the refresh delay of the sensors

Now, usables sensors are:
accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
But i hope to add more sensors in the future like barometer, gps, etc.

For the next release, I plan to add the following features:
- create and use for each sensor a noise model (gaussian, uniform, white, etc.)
