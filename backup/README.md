State Estimate Algorythm Developpment

(State : position, orientation and speeds of the system in the global reference)

Main parts of the project : 
-Simulation
-fusion algo dev
-evaluation

This project will help you to create your AHRS fusion algo.

How ? 
- By simulating your system.
    You choos what sensors used and what movments the objects will describe. 
    Then, this app simulate the datas of sensors.
    You put them in your AHRS fusion algo and compare its outputs with the scenario of the simulation.
    The more the both are close, better you AHRS is.
