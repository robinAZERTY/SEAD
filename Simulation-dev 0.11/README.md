Simulation-development kit v0.11
==========================
This v0.11 release of the Simulation Development Kit (SDK) is a minor update to the v0.10 release. It includes a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements.

Now, usables sensors are:
accelerometer and gyroscope.
But i hope to add more sensors in the future like magnetometer, barometer, gps, etc.

For the next release, I plan to add the following features:
- Add a new sensor : magnetometer
- simulate the refresh delay of the sensors
