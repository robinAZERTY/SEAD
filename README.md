State Estimate Algorithm Developpment
===============================
State* : (position, orientation and its derivates) of the system in the global reference, it describes how the objet is moving

progression of the project : no beta version yet (simulation part in progress)) 


Main parts of the project : 
    -Simulation
    -fusion algo dev
    -evaluation

This project will help you to create your AHRS fusion algo.

How ? 
- By simulating your system :
    -You chose what sensors used and what movments the objects will describe. 
    Then, this app simulate the datas of sensors.
    You put them in your AHRS fusion algo and compare its outputs with the scenario of the simulation.
    The more the both are close, better you AHRS is.
